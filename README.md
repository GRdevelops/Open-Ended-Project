# Welcome to the blog

Welcome to the Blog was conceived as a straightforward yet robust blog homepage, marking my second coding project. 

I meticulously chose descriptive names for CSS classes and JavaScript functions to ensure code clarity and maintainability. 

In terms of layout, I made sure to keep an overall consistent design with flexbox/grids. 

A key feature was integrating Mailchimp for email collection. 

Utilizing vanilla JavaScript, I implemented a pop-up that stays closed if you reload the page and a sorting functionality that shows posts relative to the selected category.

## Features
- Responsive web design ensuring compatibility across various devices and screen sizes.
- Sort articles by category thanks to Javascript.
- Javascript pop-up that has a persistent timer even on reload.
- Clean and modern user interface.

## Technologies Used
- HTML5: For structuring the content of the web pages.
- CSS3: For styling and layout of the web pages.
- JavaScript: For interactive and dynamic elements.

## Project Structure
- `index.html`: The main HTML file that contains the structure of the web page.
- `resources/`: Contains CSS and JavaScript code, along with images and fonts.

## Deployment
This website was deployed using GitHub Pages: https://grdevelops.github.io/Welcome-To-The-Blog/
